}
\arguments{
\item{original_varname}{a character vector needing renaming}

\item{char_len}{integer, the max number of characters allowed in the renamed
strings}

\item{relo_2_end}{logical, if TRUE: numerical prefix bundles will be
relocated to the end of the string. A prefix bundle is determined as a
number or "grouping of numbers separated by special characters and other
punctuation". See details section for more info on prefix bundles.}

\item{letter_for_num_prefix}{character. Will be ignored if \code{relo_2_end = TRUE}. Per CDISC & regulatory body requirements, variable names cannot
start with a number, so if you want to leave the number of the left-hand
side, use this argument to insert a starting letter before the numeric
prefix.}

\item{sep}{string of only one character long, intended to separate words from
one another. In general, only an empty string ("") and underscore ("\emph{") are
possible, but the user can insert a letter if desired. Note that "}" is
discouraged because it is only permissible for legacy studies started on or
before Dec 17, 2016.}

\item{replace_vec}{A named character vector where the name is replaced by the
value. This is helpful for finding and replacing smaller sub-strings
embedded in variable names and automatically converting them to a preferred
phrase. For example: '\%' -> "\emph{pct}".}

\item{dict_dat}{a data frame containing two variables: the \code{original_varname}
and the \code{dict_varname} used to find and replace entire variable names with
new ones. For example, "Subject ID" -> "SUBJID".}

\item{letter_case}{character, with choices c("upper", "lower", "asis")
allowing user to make the final renamed terms uppercase (the default),
lowercase, or leave them as-is, respectively. Note, lowercase is discourage
as it is not submission compliant.}

\item{case}{character, see \code{\link[snakecase]{to_any_case}} for more info
on alternate cases but some popular choices are "snake", "lower_camel", or
"parsed" (the default). From the documentation, the "parsed" case parses
out substrings and surrounds them with an underscore. Underscores at the
start and end are trimmed. No lower or upper case pattern from the input
string are changed. If \code{sep = ""}, then underscores will be trimmed later.}

\item{return_df}{logical, defaults to TRUE where entire dataset is returned
from suggestion process, else just the suggestion column itself}

\item{verbose}{logical}
}
\description{
The function takes a single character vector as input and converts each
string to be submission compliant. This means the variable must be a maximum
of 8 characters, ASCII only, and should contain only uppercase letters,
numbers and must start with a letter. No other symbols or special characters
should be included in these names. However, legacy studies started on or
before December 17, 2016 may use the underscore character "_". This function
is slightly more flexible than the submission criteria would allow, so use
the arguments wisely. \code{\link{tidy_varnames}} performs the same logic,
but directly renames the columns of a data.frame plus enforces more strict
adherence to the regulatory guidelines mentioned above.

\details{
Abbreviating variable names in the \code{xportr} pkg uses a step-by-step
process detailed below. Each original variable name will be renamed based
on the method performing the least amount of work to achieve the min
character length requirement (8 chars), thus maintaining maximum
originality. Therefore, the function only moves on to the next method on an
as-needed basis; namely, when the term is still greater than 8 characters,
even after lite modification.

\enumerate{ \item \strong{Blanks}: Any columns that are missing a variable
name (i.e., the header was blank in the source file) will be renamed to 'V'
plus the column position. So if the 2nd column is blank, it will receive a
'V2' rename.

\item \strong{Use dictionary of controlled terminology}: For example:
'Subject ID' may better be suited as 'SUBJID' within your organization.
Note, that dictionary terms are expected to be submission compliant and
will not be further abbreviated. They will, however, undergo a check for
non-compliance.

\item \strong{Do nothing!} Or at the very least, mimic what SAS does
automatically when cleaning up variable names during a PROC IMPORT. Namely,
replace any special characters & capitalize everything, etc. If the
'SASified' name is <= 8 chars, then the function will use that rename.
However, if its still too long, the function will try removing any extra
special characters or spaces to help reduce to 8 chars.

\item \strong{Find the STEM or ROOT word} of each original variable name.
For example, if the original contains the word 'resting', the 'ing' will be
dropped and only the root word 'rest' will be considered. If less than 8
chars, the algorithm suggests that result. If its still too long, the
function will, again, remove any special characters or spaces from the
stemmed word(s).

\item \strong{Apply an abbreviation algorithm} who's primary goal is
readability, such that the results remain unique. The methods described
below are a bit more 'involved', but the results are very robust. First,
you should know that characters are always stripped from the end of the
strings first (i.e. from right to left). If an element of the variable name
contains more than one word (words are separated by spaces) then at least
one letter from each word will be retained.

\strong{Method}: First spaces at the ends of the string are stripped. Then
(if necessary) any other spaces are stripped. Next, lower case vowels are
removed followed by lower case consonants. Finally if the abbreviation is
still longer than 8 chars, upper case letters and symbols are stripped.

When identifying 'words', the app performs some pre-processing steps in the
following order:
\itemize{
\item Certain symbols are replaced. Like the '\%' symbol is replaced with 'PCT'.
Ex: 'I_Ate_\%' becomes 'I_Ate_PCT'
\item Replace any symbols with a blank space. Ex: 'I_Ate' becomes 'I Ate'
\item Find when there are two capital letters next to each other, followed by a
lower case letter then adds a space between the two capital letters to
separate the assumed 'words'. Ex: 'IAte' becomes 'I Ate'
\item Insert a space between a number followed by a character. Ex: iAte1meal'
becomes 'iAte1 meal'
\item Insert a space between a character followed by a number. Ex: 'iAte1meal'
becomes 'iAte 1meal'
}

What do we abbreviate when? If a stemmed word exists, the app will apply
the abbreviation algorithm described above on the stemmed version of the
variable name, else the original variable name.

Since submission guidelines indicate variables may not start with a number,
when found, the algorithm will either add and maintain a '_' "prefix
bundle" through any transformations detailed above, or it will relocate the
"prefix bundle" to the end of the term (the default behavior). What if a
term starts with non-standard numerical prefix? Currently, the function
accounts for the following types of prefix bundles, where 3 is used as an
example starting digit:
\itemize{
\item x = "3a. hey" will return "3a"
\item x = "3_17a_hey" will return "3_17a"
\item x = "3_17_hey" will return "3_17"
\item x = "3_17hey" will return "3_17"
\item x = "3hey" will return "3" }
}
}
\examples{
vars <- c("", "studyid", "STUDYID", "subject id", "1c. ENT", "1b. Eyes",
         "1d. Lungs", "1e. Heart", "year number", "1a. Skin_Desc")

# Default behavior
tidy_rename(vars)
tidy_rename(vars, letter_case = "asis")

# Leave numerical prefix on left-hand side, but add a starting letter
tidy_rename(vars, relo_2_end = FALSE, letter_for_num_prefix = "x")

# Add a dictionary and remove underscores
tidy_rename(vars, sep = "",
 dict_dat = data.frame(original_varname = "subject id", dict_varname = "subjid"))
