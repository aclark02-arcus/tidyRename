\description{
Supply a character string or vector, returns the same vector with changed
case. Notice, this function just uses \code{toupper()} or \code{tolower()} but the
string, \code{x}, may have been altered by the janitor package's use of
\code{\link[snakecase]{to_any_case}} later on, when suggesting a rename
}
