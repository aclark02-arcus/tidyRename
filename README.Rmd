## Installation

You can install the development version of tidyRename from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aclark02-arcus/tidyRename")
```

## Purpose

# What are the checks?

<br>

- Variable names must start with a letter (not an underscore), be comprised of only uppercase letters (A-Z), numerals (0-9) and be free of non-ASCII characters, symbols, and underscores.
- Allotted length for each column containing character (text) data
should be set to the maximum length of the variable used across all
data sets (≤ 200)
- Coerces variables to only numeric or character types
- Display format support for numeric float and date/time values
- Variables names are ≤ 8 characters.
- Variable labels are ≤ 200 characters. 
- Data set labels are ≤ 40 characters.
- Presence of non-ASCII characters in Variable Names, Labels or data set labels.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# library(tidyRename)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
