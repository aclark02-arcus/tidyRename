Description: Reduces by automating the creation of submission compliant 
    variable attributes (i.e. <=8 characters for variable names, <=40 
    characters for labels). Concepts can be expanded to CSR activities i.e., 
    SDTM variables mapping process etc. to ensure uniformity among users and 
    eliminates wasted time manually creating easily-readable variable names for 
    high dimensional data sets.
